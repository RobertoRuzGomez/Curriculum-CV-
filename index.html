    <h3>Description.</h3>
    <p>2014 After the university I started to work as a Data Analyst in privated companie related with health and medicine, coding a software in VBA Excel that could help the supply deparment to find efficient amount of tools that doctors use in each surgery. Then I jumped to the Bank industry where I was coding in SQL Server and SaaS, doing econometry and calculating mortgage rates. Finally I worked for a goverment institution, managing project’s budgets.
These experiences were incredible helpful from a profesional point of view since I improved and develop new skills but the world is getting small and by 2016 I decided that I had to move forward and challenge myselft.
Mid June 2016, I took a flight to Toronto-canada, the fun starts here, Imagine a dude that used to dress suits and tieses at the" small chilean wall street" now working as a demolition laboure at the heart of Toronto, Bloor and Spanida street junction crazy isn't it? working as a cleaner and chees maker. In that beautiful country I lived one and a half year where I meet stonishing people.
October 2018 Mount Maunganui New Zealand, prunning kiwis the starting job then many more mussel, garlic, timber factories, etc. Wineries and Vinyards were my favorites jobs, I actually learnt a bit of wine, pinot noir and cabernet sauvignon the kings depending on which book you are reading and chardonnay with no doubts the queen.
I spent again 1, 5 years in New Zealand but I had to continue and my next destiny was Japan Osaka.it felt like live in another world, amazing culture and I truly experienced the "Kaizen", a word that westen countries uses as of concept of improvement in their businnes, I can say without fear of make a mistake that Kaizen is the way japannes people work everyday, does not matter if you are an CEO of the company or just a simple employees.
After Japan, finally I traveled to Australia where I am writing this "About",travelling around this wonderful contry Tasmania and sydney were the cities that I chose to live, working in packhouses, potatos farm, wineries. construction sites, driving tractor, farm work and wearhouse.
Having said that I feel really lucky for those amazing and mindful experiences and now I am looking forward to follow my profesional path using all the knowledges that acquired at the university, jobs and travels.
Feel free to reach me out if you need someone with the characteristic decribed above. I am "solve maker", that feel confortable using new techs and numbers, sociable and story teller.
Thank you for have read until here, I would be please to share a coffe, "Lets Talk".</p>
